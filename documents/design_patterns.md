# Design Patterns:

1. **Command Pattern**: Use the Command pattern to encapsulate each command (record, query) into its own class with a common execution interface.
2. **Strategy Pattern**: Implement the Strategy pattern to switch between different output formatting styles.
3. **Factory Pattern**: Use the Factory pattern to create instances of commands or formatters based on input.
